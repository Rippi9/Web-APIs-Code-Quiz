# Your Task

The obejective of this challenge was to creat a timed coding quiz game from scratch. This was to include; multiple-choice questions that will run in the browser along with a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

# User Story

AS A coding boot camp student I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz:

WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my initials and my score

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
